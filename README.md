# Dead-by-Daylight-Perk-Shuffle
This app is a perk shuffle for Dead by Daylight. Its a fun addition to your game! Choose from a handful of themes, select owned perks, and do fun modes and challenges!

I plan to integrate many features into this app. I am hoping to eventually turn this into a companion app.

When you first open the app, you will see many options!

The first option is to select the theme you want to use. I have a few neon themes and a few solid color themes you can select from.

Now, you cannot shuffle perks until you select at least four perks. To do this, click the perk selection tab and select either all, or you can search perks instead of scrolling. They are all in alphabetical order.

Once you have selected perks, you can now shuffle! The first shuffle mode is the basic mode. You click shuffle and it will give you four random perks.

The next mode is Draft Mode. In Draft Mode, it prompts you with three perks to select for each slot and you choose one until all four slots are filled. You basically get random perks but you still have some control over what perks you have in your build.

You also have a shuffle history. Let's say you enjoy a build and you forgot what it was, you can view the history and see what perks you shuffled recently. It shows the last 25 builds. You can also clear the history.

Lastly, you can check for updates! As I mentioned, I will always be updating this application!
